# D-Star-Pathfinding-Visualization
The D* (Dynamic A*) algorithm is an extension of the A* (A-star) algorithm used primarily in robotics and path planning. It is designed to handle dynamic environments where obstacles may appear or disappear during the execution of a pathfinding task. The key feature of D* is its ability to replan efficiently as new information is received about the environment, which makes it suitable for situations where the map of the environment is not fully known in advance or may change over time. Unlike A*, which computes a static path from a start to a goal, D* allows for the path to be adjusted when changes in the environment are detected.

1. Use Right click for start/goal
2. Left click for obstacles
3. Press Space_bar for Start searching
